// Use a tuple index to access the second element of `numbers`. You can put the
// expression for the second element where ??? is so that the test passes.
//
// Execute `rustlings hint primitive_types6` or use the `hint` watch subcommand
// for a hint.

fn indexing_tuple() {
    let numbers = (1, 2, 3);
    // Replace below ??? with the tuple indexing syntax.
    let second = numbers.1;

    assert_eq!(2, second,
        "This is not the 2nd number in the tuple!")
}

// Writeup
// Here we want second to be equal to 2, to do this we acces the second element of the tuple with the syntax numbers.1
// because indexing in rust starts at 0.
